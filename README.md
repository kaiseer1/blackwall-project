BlackWall: AI-Driven Cybersecurity Defense

Author: Basil Abdullah Version: 1.0 Date: 2025 Affiliation: Al-Baha University

Overview:

BlackWall is an AI-powered cybersecurity framework designed to autonomously detect, contain, and neutralize cyber threats in real-time. Unlike traditional security solutions that rely on static rule-based detection, BlackWall leverages machine learning, deception-based security, and deep system monitoring to provide a proactive and intelligent defense mechanism.
This project is built to be modular, scalable, and efficient, integrating multiple cybersecurity layers to predict, deceive, and neutralize cyber threats before they escalate.

Features:

Network Traffic Monitoring – Continuously scans and analyzes real-time network packets for malicious behavior.
AI-Powered Threat Detection – Uses machine learning to detect anomalous patterns and unknown threats.
Automated Threat Containment – Blocks and isolates cyber threats using firewall adjustments & access control policies.
Deception-Based Security – Implements honeypots and False Positive Protocol (FPP) to mislead attackers.
Kernel-Level Security Enforcement – Monitors deep system calls (Ring 0) for unauthorized activity.
Global Threat Intelligence Integration – Continuously updates defense mechanisms using external security feeds.

Installation:

Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system before running BlackWall:

Python 3.9+

pip (Python package manager)

Required Dependencies

Before running BlackWall, install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Dataset Installation:

To train and use the AI model effectively, download the CIC-IDS-2017 dataset: "http://cicresearch.ca/CICDataset/CIC-IDS-2017/Dataset/CIC-IDS-2017/CSVs/MachineLearningCSV.zip"

Download the CSV files: Friday-WorkingHours-Afternoon-PortScan.pcap_ISCX.csv and Thursday-WorkingHours-Afternoon-Infilteration.pcap_ISCX.csv

Extract and place the CSV files inside the datasets/ directory.

Usage

Training the AI Model

To train the AI model using real-world cybersecurity datasets:

python blackwall.py

This will load the network traffic datasets, train the RandomForest-based intrusion detection model, and generate a model.pkl file.

The trained model will then be used for real-time threat detection.

Running the Cyber Defense System

Once trained, BlackWall can autonomously monitor and defend against cyber threats.

To start monitoring your network:

python blackwall.py --monitor

How BlackWall Works

Loads network traffic datasets (PCAP & CSV format).

Extracts key network features (packet behavior, flags, and timing analysis).

Preprocesses the data – cleans missing values, normalizes features, and removes outliers.

Trains a machine learning model – Random Forest classifier detects normal vs. attack traffic.

Applies deception-based security – sends attackers into controlled honeypots instead of allowing real intrusions.

Monitors system and network logs for live anomaly detection.

Automates containment – blocks malicious traffic in real-time using firewall rules & system-level defenses.

Future Enhancements

Reinforcement Learning Integration – Adaptive AI that learns from real-world attack patterns.

Cloud Security Deployment – Expand protection for AWS, Azure, and GCP environments.

Blockchain Security Logs – Immutable logs to prevent forensic tampering.

Real-time EDR/NDR Integration – Full compatibility with enterprise security tools.
