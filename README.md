## Usage

### Command Line Interface
BlackWall provides a comprehensive command-line interface:

```bash
# Start real-time monitoring
python blackwall.py --monitor

# Specify network interfaces
python blackwall.py --monitor --interface eth0,eth1

# Enable verbose logging
python blackwall.py --monitor --verbose

# Run in debug mode
python blackwall.py --monitor --debug

# View system statistics
python blackwall.py --stats

### Integration API
BlackWall can be integrated into existing security infrastructure:

```python
from blackwall import BlackWall

# Initialize with custom configuration
bw = BlackWall(config_path="custom_config.yml")

# Start monitoring specific interfaces
bw.start_monitoring(interfaces=["eth0", "wlan0"])

# Register callback for threat alerts
bw.on_threat_detected(callback_function)

# Access monitoring statistics
stats = bw.get_stats()
```

## AI and Machine Learning

BlackWall employs multiple machine learning approaches:

### Supervised Learning
- Classification of known attack patterns
- Feature extraction from network flows

### Unsupervised Learning
- Behavioral baseline establishment
- Anomaly detection for unknown threats

### Adaptive Model Training
- Continuous learning from new data
- Model validation against false positives

## Architecture

BlackWall is built on a modular architecture:

- **Core Engine** - Central processing and coordination
- **Network Monitor** - Packet capture and analysis
- **Model Manager** - AI model training and execution
- **Log Manager** - Secure logging and audit trails
- **FPP System** - Honeypot and deception technology

## Estimated Benchmarks

| Deployment Size | Packets/sec | Memory Usage | CPU Load |
|-----------------|-------------|--------------|----------|
| Small Office    | 10,000      | 200MB        | 5-10%    |
| Medium Business | 50,000      | 500MB        | 15-20%   |
| Enterprise      | 200,000+    | 1.2GB        | 25-40%   |

## Dataset Requirements

BlackWall requires network traffic datasets for training. Two sample datasets are used by default:

1. **Sampled_Dataset_Example.csv** - Contains labeled network traffic data (5000 rows)
2. **Final_Preprocessed_Dataset_Sample.csv** - Contains preprocessed network features

For optimal results, ensure that datasets include a "Label" column for classifying traffic patterns.

## Future Roadmap

### Q2 2025
- Integration with SIEM platforms
- Enhanced cloud workload protection

### Q3 2025
- Reinforcement learning models
- Automated threat hunting capabilities

### Q4 2025
- Comprehensive IoT device protection
